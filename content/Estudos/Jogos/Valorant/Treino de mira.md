## NOVICE - Duration 30 Minutes
### VT x WHJ Smooth Strafe Sphere Easy [3x]
#### Why
Smoothness is fundamental to the correct execution of many elements of aiming whether it’s flicking, tracking, or target switching. The strafes are relatively small, to simulate having to hit a shot on a moving target with good crosshair placement.
#### How
Focus on staying relaxed and don’t try to anticipate any strafes from the bot. Naturally react to changes in direction and continue tracking strafes for their entire length.
### VT Adjust Track VALORANT Easy [3x]
#### Why
In addition to providing further smoothness practice, this scenario’s bot introduces rapid target movements that the aim training community refers to as “blinks”.
#### How
Try to remain as centered as possible within the bot itself and make sure you’re properly acquiring the target's new location immediately following the occurrence of a blink before you correct to it. While this correction should always be a fast flick, ensure you prioritize control and push that starting speed further overtime.

### 2 Minute rest

### VT BerryTS Static Entry [3x]

#### Why
Wide angle flicks see the most use in VALORANT when an immediate threat appears from an unexpected location. There’s also use in closer ranges where opponents can cross your field of view rapidly, with fewer steps.
#### How
These targets are large enough that the need for micro-correcting should be infrequent. Try to land your initial flick directly onto the bot in one fast and controlled motion. The speed of these flicks should be intentional. as newer players tend to “drag” their mouse slowly on larger flicks.

### VT x WHJ ww4t Small Pokeball [3x]
#### Why
This scenario puts an extra emphasis on control as opposed to the previous scenario.
#### How
Since these targets are smaller along with the playable area of this scenario being wider, controlled accurate movements are an absolute must. A more frequent use of micro-corrections is necessary to approach a reasonable pace.
### 2 Minute rest

### VT x WHJ 5 Sphere Hipfire Small Pokeball [3x]
#### Why
Micro-corrections are easily the most frequent aiming technique used by all VALORANT players and any level of aiming success cannot be achieved without it. If your crosshair placement is good your crosshair will always be very close to your target, and a proper micro-correction will secure the elimination.
#### How
Take advantage of the close spacing between bots and try to land your initial flick directly onto them. In this instance each flick you make is representative of the adjustment you’re trying to make in game. Remember to hold down your Fire Weapon key on your keyboard for the duration of the scenario. (Default Left Control)

### VT 1w4ts Clusters [3x]
#### Why
This continues the micro-correction work, but with one less target and a larger play area, the distance between targets is more varied.
#### How
Ensure you keep your initial flick lines straight while maintaining their explosiveness. Intentionally force underflicks and only click once your micro-correction has been fully completed.(Maintain 94% accuracy minimum)
### 2 Minute rest
### VT Angleshot Micro VALORANT Multi [3x]
#### Why
Since opponents do not always provide us the courtesy of standing still, we have to account for possible strafes that need to be compensated for.
#### How
Perform three clicks on the target to eliminate it and spawn the next one. Make sure you are visually confirming your crosshair on the target before each click.
### VT x WHJ TwoShot Pressure [3x]
#### Why
This scenario should make you comfortable with intentionally pacing your flicks based on circumstances around you.
Prioritize larger targets to prevent targets from disappearing. Do not wait for targets to reach a certain size before attempting to eliminate them.
